# 🧠 SQL Portfolio – Real-World Data Insights with SQL

Welcome to my **SQL portfolio** – a collection of hands-on projects showcasing my ability to analyze, clean, and transform data using pure SQL. These projects span across industries and use real-world datasets to deliver meaningful insights and business recommendations.

## 📌 About Me

I'm a data enthusiast with strong skills in **SQL querying, data modeling, and storytelling**. I use SQL not only as a querying language but as a powerful analytical tool to solve business problems, uncover trends, and communicate insights effectively.
